# 📊 Data Analyst Job Market Dashboard (2024)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the data job market, focusing on roles like Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts. Built using **Microsoft Power BI**, this dashboard provides actionable insights into salary trends, remote work opportunities, and skill requirements across different geographies.

The goal of this analysis is to help job seekers understand:
- Which roles pay the highest salaries?
- Is a degree strictly required for data roles?
- What are the trends for remote vs. on-site work?
- How does compensation vary by location (USA, UK, India, France)?

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

Based on the visual analysis of the dataset, here are the key takeaways:

### 1. 💰 Salary Analysis
- **Top Earners:** Senior Data Scientists and Senior Data Engineers command the highest median yearly salaries globally.
- **Hourly vs. Yearly:** There is a strong positive correlation between hourly rates and yearly salaries across job titles.
- **Location Impact:** The United States offers the highest median salaries compared to the UK, France, and India.

### 2. 🎓 Education & Requirements
- **Degree Not Always Mandatory:** Approximately **32.5%** of job postings did not explicitly mention a degree requirement, indicating opportunities for skill-based hiring.
- **Top "No-Degree" Roles:** Data Engineers and Data Analysts have the highest number of openings where a degree is not a strict barrier.

### 3. 📅 Work Schedule & Trends
- **Remote Work Reality:** Only **13.15%** of the analyzed jobs offer a fully "Work From Home" option, while the vast majority are on-site or hybrid.
- **Market Trend (2024):** The trend line indicates a fluctuation in job postings throughout 2024, with a noticeable dip towards the end of the year.
- **Full-Time Dominance:** The majority of listings are for Full-Time positions, with Contractor roles making up a smaller segment (~6.5%).

## 🛠️ Technical Skills & Tools Used
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and data visualization.
- **Power Query:** For data cleaning, transformation, and ETL processes.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to calculate key metrics like Median Salary and Job Counts.
- **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between job titles, locations, and salary tables.
